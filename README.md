# SignWarp

A Bukkit plugin for teleportation using signs.
**(Minecraft Version 1.20.4)**

SignWarp allows players to place signs to teleport between them with a simple right-click.

By default, teleportation costs one ender pearl, which must be in the player's hand when interacting with the sign, but this can also be disabled in the configuration.
## Permissions

- `signwarp.create` - Allow creation and destruction of warp signs (default: op)
- `signwarp.use` - Allow usage of warp signs (default: everyone)
- `signwarp.reload` - Allow access to reload (default: op)
- `signwarp.*` - Allow access to all features (default: op)

Commands:
- `/signwarp reload` - Reloads the configuration.
## How to Use

First, place a sign where you want to teleport with the following content:

- First line: **[WarpTarget]**
- Second line: The name you want to use

This will create a warp sign that sets the location to which a player teleports.

After creating the warp sign, create one or more warp signs from which you want to teleport to the target sign.

This is done by placing a sign with the following content:

- First line: **[Warp]**
- Second line: The name you want to use

**Note: The target sign (WarpTarget) must exist before creating the warp sign!**

Once you have created both signs, you can right-click with the `use-item` in your hand (by default, it's an ender pearl).
Each teleportation will cost the number of items configured in `use-cost` (default: 1).

You can remove the `use-item` option in the config.yml or set it to "none" to allow any item to be used (i.e., each warp is free per use).
## Message Customization

In the `config.yml` configuration file, you have the option to customize the messages used by the plugin. These messages are defined under the key messages and can be modified according to your preferences.

**Preview :**

```yaml
messages:
  create_permission: "&cYou do not have the required permissions to create warp signs!"
  no_warp_name: "&cNo warp name set!\nPlease specify the warp name on the second line."
  warp_created: "&aWarp sign successfully placed."
  warp_name_taken: "&cA warp target with the same name already exists!"
  warp_destroyed: "&aWarp destroyed."
  target_sign_created: "&aTarget sign for warp successfully placed."
  destroy_permission: "&cYou do not have the required permissions to destroy warp signs!"
  invalid_item: "&cYou must use {use-item} for this warp!"
  not_enough_item: "&cYou need {use-cost} {use-item} for this warp!"
  warp_not_found: "&cSpecified warp does not exist!"
  use_permission: "&cYou do not have the required permissions to use the warp sign!"
  teleport: "&eTeleporting to {warp-name}..."
  not_permission: "&cYou do not have permission!"
  ```

- `{warp-name}` : This placeholder is replaced by the name of the warp specified on the sign.
- `{use-item}` : Used to represent the name of the item required to use the warp. For example, if the required item is an ender pearl, this placeholder will be replaced by "ENDER_PEARL".
- `{use-cost}` : This placeholder is replaced by the number of items needed to use the warp. For example, if the cost to use the warp is 1 ender pearl, this placeholder will be replaced by "1".

You have the option to stylize your texts with Minecraft color codes. These codes start with the & character, followed by a letter or number representing a specific color. [More informations](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/color_list_pc.php)

## Sound and Effect Customization

You can customize the sound and effect played during teleportation in the `config.yml` configuration file:
[List Sound](https://www.digminecraft.com/lists/sound_list_pc.php) and [List Effect](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Effect.html)

**Note : The sound and effect must be in uppercase and replace "." by "_" for the sound.**

**Preview :**
```yaml
teleport-sound: ENTITY_ENDERMAN_TELEPORT
teleport-effect: ENDER_SIGNAL
```
